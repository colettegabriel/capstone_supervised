# Capstone 3: Detecting Fraud in a Mobile Money System

The dataset used in this project contains over 6 million simulated data transactions with a tiny percent (0.129%)
representing fraud transactions. The goal is to work with an imbalanced dataset to detect anomalies (fraud transactions)
while minimizing Type I and II errors.

This project contains a PDF slide presentation in addition to the Jypter notebook.
